	<h2>Feedback: We want to hear from you as we improve our beta release!</h2>
	<p>At Loxley, we are committed and driven individuals who are looking to improve the educational community one step at a time. With your feedback and reviews in mind, we hope to not only help establish ourselves as the leader in textbook reviews, but help professors, students, and publishers make conscious and more informed selections of textbooks used in their courses. Please feel free to e-mail us with your thoughts on our beta website so we can better prepare and adjust accordingly. The only way for us to grow is through constructive criticism and recommendations so we want to hear from you!</p>
